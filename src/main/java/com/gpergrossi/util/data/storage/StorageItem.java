/**
 * All classes in the "storage" package are based on this interface and the containers that 
 * implement the Storage interface.
 * 
 * These storage classes place maximum priority on speed and are design to deal with very large
 * numbers of elements. As such, items are stored as contiguously as possible (to increase cache
 * performance at least as far as the array of object references) without using memory copies.
 * 
 * Elements stored in these classes must implement the StorageItem interface so that they can be
 * assigned an index. These indices are used to provide constant time lookup and removal from the
 * data structures at the cost of the necessary memory. However the design goals for these data
 * structures were to provide speed as a highest priority.
 * 
 * The StorageItem interface is implemented by the AbstractStorageItem class for convenience.
