/**
 * All classes in the "storage" package are based on this interface and the StorageItem interface.
 * 
 * These storage classes place maximum priority on speed (rather than memory) and are designed to deal
 * with large numbers of dynamically changing elements. Items are stored as contiguously as possible 
 * without using memory copies. The hope is to increase cache performance when iterating (at least as 
 * far as the array of object references). I don't know much about the JVM's organization of object
 * arrays, but I hope that this makes at least some sense. 
 * 
 * Elements stored in these classes must implement the StorageItem interface so that they can be
 * assigned an index. These indices are used to provide constant time lookup and removal from the
 * data structures at the cost of the small amount of necessary memory.
